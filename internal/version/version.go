// Version is the semantic version of this build, and the default for a build

//
// It tracks the newest tag on main — currently v0.0.11 — so ad-hoc builds
// identify themselves with the branch's latest published lineage.

// Codename is the release line's thematic name — v0.0.11 is "Rendezvous", the
// orbital meeting: sibling tasks exchange notes mid-flight on the message
// board, delegated hops relay contexts and artifacts up the chain, and agent
// work meets an undo point instead of drifting past one. (The alpha/beta line
// ran as "Periapsis", but that name already belongs to v0.0.9.) Surfaced by
// `panda version` and /api/version; not part of the semver itself.

// ReleaseDate is the day this release line shipped, "2006-01-02". It is the
// one field of the release identity the build cannot derive — a binary knows
// its version but not when that version went out — so it is edited alongside
// Version and Codename when a release is cut, and left empty for ad-hoc
// builds that never had a release day. The console's profile page prints it
// as "发布于 …" and falls back to omitting the line when it is empty.
